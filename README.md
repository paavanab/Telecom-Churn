# Telecom-Churn Logistic Regression/Random Forest/XGBoost
A Project to predict telecom service churn customers. 
We built multiple models in logistic regression, random forest and xg boost with and without dimensionality reduction.
After considering Accuracy, Recall and Precision Balance the final model selected is XGB Hypertuned model on dimension reduced PCA data with SMOTE
Some of the factors that affect churn are :
  Average Revenue Per User for both good and action phase.
  The roaming outgoing minutes of usage in both good and action phase.
  The roaming incoming minutes of usage in action phase.
Some measures the company can take to prevent churn is :
  The Network operators must futher investigate their roaming tariffs, and quality of service.
  Roll out attractive offers on roaming packages based on previous month's roaming usage.
  If the network and service quality for roaming is the issue proper measures have to be taken to fix that to avoid long term loss of customers.
  We can also notice that high data usage customers churn lesser the company must focus on providing best service at affordable prices in order to gain customer loyalty.
  The minimum recharge value can be as low as possible so that they can retain customers who mostly use only incoming services to retain customers. Since customer retention could be much more cost effective when compared to customer acquisition
